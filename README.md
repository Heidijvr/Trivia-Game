**Project Requirements:**
* To show one question until the player answers it, otherwise their time runs out.
* If players select the correct answer, a screen appears which congratulates them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds,
  the next question is displayed without any user input.
* If players choose the wrong answer, a screen appears which informs them that they selected the wrong option together with the correct
  answer. After a few seconds, the next question appears. 
* In case of a time-out: "Time's up!" appears on the screen and the correct answer is displayed. After a few 
  seconds, the next question appears. 

-----

**Suggested future challenges:**
* Update the navigation to let users skip to any question number.
* Create custom messages for each level of results. For example, if someone scores 8/10 or higher, call them a _quiz master_.
* Add a countdown timer to see if people can beat the clock.
