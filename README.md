#**Challenges:**

#**Project Requirements:**
* To show one question until the player answers it, otherwise their time runs out.
* If players select the correct answer, a screen appears which congratulates them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed without any user input.
* If players choose the wrong answer, a screen appears which informs them that they selected the wrong option together with the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
* In case of a time-out: Tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

#**Suggested future challenges:**
* Update the navigation to let users skip to any question number.
* Create custom messages for each level of results. For example, if someone scores 8/10 or higher, call them a _quiz master_.
* Add a countdown timer to see if people can beat the clock.
